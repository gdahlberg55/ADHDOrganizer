# ADHDOrganizer Product Context

## Problem Space
Individuals with ADHD often struggle with executive functioning, which includes organizing and categorizing items. Digital file management presents particular challenges:

1. **Overwhelming Decision Fatigue**: Having to decide where each file should go creates cognitive load
2. 2. **Inconsistent Organization**: Without automated systems, organization is often inconsistent
   3. 3. **Out of Sight, Out of Mind**: Files that aren't visible are often forgotten
      4. 4. **Time Consumption**: Manual organization takes time away from more important tasks
         5. 5. **Frustration Cycle**: The buildup of disorganized files creates anxiety, which further impedes organization
           
            6. ## Solution Approach
            7. ADHDOrganizer addresses these issues by:
           
            8. 1. **Removing Decision-Making**: Automatically categorizing files based on predetermined rules
               2. 2. **Creating Consistency**: Applying the same organizational structure consistently
                  3. 3. **Providing Visibility**: Maintaining a history of file movements for easy retrieval
                     4. 4. **Saving Time**: Automating a repetitive task that consumes mental energy
                        5. 5. **Breaking the Frustration Cycle**: Creating order without requiring executive function
                          
                           6. ## Implementation Variants
